## Project RUDRA
### ROAD UTILISATION DEMOGRAPHICS WITH REALTIME ANALYTICS


### Motivation

Frequent accidents are being reported every year during Yatra season because of vehicle over speedings. Currently there is no monitoring system in place to identify the over speeders on the mountain roads. It is critical to have a simple, cheap and yet robust average speed monitoring system to effectively manage this issue. On facing the similar problem, few road management authorities including the one in Tirumala Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh are using vehicle average speed mapping systems to identify the over speeders. This project aims to develop and pilot test a QR code based vehicle tracking to ensure the road safety to all the Yatra pilgrims. 

### RUDRA Protects You

It is estimated that around 3 Lakh different passenger vehicles pass through the three routes to Gangotri, Yamunotri and other in a single Yatra. Each of the three routes will be equipped with a police booth at their entry points. Each and every passenger vehicle will be issued a QR code sticker for his front or rear glass. The QR code will be scanned along with the number plate of the vehicle by a traffic police during entry. This information along with the time stamp and GPS coordinated will be uploaded securely on the cloud server instantly. 

Once the vehicles cross the entry points, they can be crosschecked at temporary scanning points and also at every police booth on the way with a mobile application. Each time a vehicle is scanned for the QR, its time stamp and the GPS coordinates will be automatically uploaded online. So every vehicle will have a tracking history of information on its positions and average speeds. This will help the traffic cops to zero down on the culprits and help protect the innocents.
