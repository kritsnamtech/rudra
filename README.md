## Project RUDRA
### ROAD UTILISATION DEMOGRAPHICS WITH REALTIME ANALYTICS


### Motivation

Frequent accidents are being reported every year during Yatra season because of vehicle over speedings. Currently there is no monitoring system in place to identify the over speeders on the mountain roads. It is critical to have a simple, cheap and yet robust average speed monitoring system to effectively manage this issue. On facing the similar problem, few road management authorities including the one in Tirumala Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh are using vehicle average speed mapping systems to identify the over speeders. This project aims to develop and pilot test a QR code based vehicle tracking to ensure the road safety to all the Yatra pilgrims.
